Game
-	Use the Gloss library for graphics
-	The game should have a bit of “action” and “intelligence”
-	Use good functional programming 
-	There should be many moving parts or things to handle on screen so no RPG’s or chess, but thinks like arcade, platform, shooters, sports and race games.

Minimal requirements
- 	Player controls using the keyboard
- 	Enemies
-	Randomness
-	Animation : some events should span several frames
-	Pause functionality
-	Interaction with the file system: saving highscores

Optional requirements
- 	Levels: selectable from a list, with different characteristics
-	Different enemies: types, apearance, behavior, make harder ones appear later
-	Custom levels from a file
-	Mouse input
-	Multiplayer at the same time
-	Networkinging: multiplayer via network
-	Complex graphics: parallax scroller or loading with the file system
-	Automated testing using QuickCheck
-	Use JSON to save information


Preliminary design document
-	What game do you plan to implement
-	Rough idea how to implement the game

-	Description of your game: satisfying the minimal requirements
-	A description of the data types and type classes you want to use, using the guidelines so that we get feedback

Style
-	Data type definition. Think about the game data in memory.  Use different data types for different goals
-	Use abstraction. Use (higher-order) functions. Use type classes to implement functionality common to several data types.
-	Separate pure and impure parts. Most of the rendering and update functions can be written in a pure style.
-	Modularity. Split your code into functions, and those functions into modules. Keep their size undercontrol
-	Follow good practices. Try to use higher-order functions instead of recursion,use pattern matching to define equations, do not use magic numbers.
-	Document your code. Write type signatures for all your functions. Explain in comments.

Outcome: Send via Submit sytem in a zip file with:
-	The original design document, updated to reflect the design that was implemented. 
	Please ensure that this document explains how to play the game and how all the requirements are approached.
-	The source code as a Cabal project. Please do not include the dist folder.
